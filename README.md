EMLab Agent-Based Model

EMLab is a suite of Agent-Based Models dealing with policy questions on the long-term evolution of the electricity sector. It contains various scenarios, agent descriptions and behaviors, that allows the user to capture developments in this sector. The research using this model focuses on CO2 and renewables policy, generation adequacy, capacity mechanisms, investment risk and behaviour and open data. The project makes use of the the AgentSpring modelling framework.
